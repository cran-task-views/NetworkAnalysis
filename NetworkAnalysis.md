This CRAN task view provides a curated list of R packages for analyzing and
modelling networks (also known as _relational data_ or _graphs_). These tools
facilitate the exploration of natural, social, and other phenomena by focusing
on the relationships between entities.

This page lists a number of packages, and sometimes core functions, in several
sections based on their scope and focus:

1. The first section outlines the main ecosystems of R packages that include
basic network-analytic operations such as creating, manipulating, and describing
relational data. Here we also list choices of graphical packages for
visualizing or drawing networks. For those new to network analysis in R, we
recommend starting with the `igraph` introduction (Cs√°rdi and Nepus 2006) or the
`statnet` tutorial (Bojanowski and Jasny 2024).

2. Subsequently, packages and functions for advanced network-analytical tasks
are presented. We currently structure these into three subsections: (1)
centrality, (2) community detection, and (3) model-based clustering.

3. Then, packages offering modelling and inferential tools applicable across
disciplines and fields of interest are discussed. A distinction is drawn
between models that are primarily for cross-sectional anddynamic data, with an
extra section on special models for multimodal, multilevel, and multiplex data. 

4. Finally, the focus shifts to packages containing data structures, methods,
and models with a narrower field of application. The list includes some of the
areas where network methods are more widely applied: ecology, bibliometrics,
life and natural sciences, neurosciences, psychology, public health, social
sciences and economics.

The list excludes packages that primarily deal with graph representations of
conditional in/dependence between variables. This includes Bayesian networks
and Markovian graphs, which, despite their relevance to statistical modeling,
are covered under the CRAN task view `r view("GraphicalModels")`. This
distinction keeps the list focused on network analysis to explore broader
relational dynamics.

Some packages could appear under multiple headings because they can perform
multiple tasks (e.g., clustering and visualization). But, for the sake of
brevity, non-core packages are listed only once: in the section that described
each package's main use case.

If you think that a package is missing from the list, please file an issue in
the GitHub repository or contact the maintainer.

## Ecosystems and Data

### Ecosystems

The starting point for analyzing networks in R is to familiarize with the main
package 'families' or ecosystems. Using them, users can access functions to
create, import/export, edit, and otherwise operate on relational data.

- `r pkg("igraph", priority = "core")` provides tools for creating,
  manipulating, and analyzing network structures with a focus on graphical
  representations and fast algorithms to operate on large datasets (particularly
  manipulating data and dealing with vertex attributes). Rather than coming
  bundled with other packages, `r pkg("igraph")` offers an ecosystem of extensions
  and add-ons.

  - *Approach*: This R package is built upon a C library that is shared also by
    implementations in Python and Mathematica. The C code is efficient, and the
    R interface is increasingly consistent and easy to use with a lot of basic
    functionality, including calculating network properties, generating random
    graphs for simulations, etc.

  - *Flexibility*: Many of the functions are provided in two versions: for
    direct assignment and a pipe-able version.
  
  - *Support*: There are tons of online resources answering virtually any
    question concerning _how_ to do almost anything thanks to a large community
    and active maintainers.
  
  - *Extensions*: There are a number of add-on packages that integrate igraph
    with `r pkg("ggplot2")` and other drawing tools or provide sample datasets.
    According to the latest review this is the largest network-analysis
    ecosystem in R by number of extensions (see Kanevsky 2016).

- [Statnet](http://statnet.org/) is a suite of R packages for analysis
  and statistical modeling of networks that forms a core of an
  ecosystem of packages for statistical network analysis built upon
  common data representations (particularly the `r pkg("network",
  priority = "core")` package) and design choices. Meta-package `r
  pkg("statnet", priority = "core")` makes it easy to install the core
  packages in the suite.

  - *Approach*: The approach in this group of packages is more
    disaggregated and involves a number of different packages for
    different purposes. In particular, whereas `r pkg("igraph")`
    implements both the data structure and network analysis methods,
    `r pkg("network")` does not implement network analysis methods but
    relies on other packages, such as `r pkg("sna", priority =
    "core")` and the `r pkg("ergm")` family.
 
  - *Flexibility*: The packages in the Statnet suite can be used to analyze
  (social) network data using both direct assignment and a 'piped' approach. 
 
  - *Comprehensiveness*: This ecosystem's biggest advantage is that it allows
    users to carry out most network-analytical operations, especially in dealing
    with social network analysis (SNA). But the trade-off, of course, is that
    the number of possibilities makes life harder for new users.

- `r pkg("manynet", priority = "core")` is built upon many of the other network
  packages in this list and offers interoperability with many different classes
  of objects as well as network visualization and analytic tools.

  - *Approach*: Inspired by the [_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org/),
    `manynet` offers a piped syntax, with even more structure, consistency, and
    sensible defaults. For example, `manynet::net_*` functions always return a
    single value (scalar), and `manynet::node_*` and `manynet::tie_*` always
    return a vector the length of the nodes or ties in the network,
    respectively. Similarly, `manynet::is_*` functions always return logical
    values (`TRUE`/`FALSE`), for example. This helps new users and those working
    with multiple packages alike.
 
  - *Flexibility*: the package leverages S3 dispatching so that all the
    functions work with many _classes_ of network objects, such as `r pkg
    ("network")` or `r bioc("graph")` objects, but also edge lists, matrices, and
    various other more specific classes.  Its coercion routines retain more
    information than the long-standing alternative `r pkg ("intergraph")`, being
    able to transform between more classes and receiving more frequent updates. 
    It also includes more complete import and export routines than generalist
    packages.
 
  - *Comprehensiveness*: the package wraps most of `r pkg("igraph")`'s offerings
    but extends or corrects them to treat many _types_ of networks, including
    two-mode, multiplex, and dynamic networks. The package also implements a
    number of functions for network analysis that are not available elsewhere.

  - *Documentation*: The package benefits from clear and concise documentation,
    making it accessible to users of all levels. Additionally, it offers
    straightforward tutorials and examples to help users get started with
    network analysis in R.  Further explanation, examples, and references are
    continually being to the documentation to provide user reference and support
    user experience.

### Relational data management and conversion tools

Although the 'core' packages for network analysis in R can create a wide range
of networks from different types of inputs, there are also specialized packages
for constructing more specialized formats or for converting or coercing between
different formats.

- Core packages `r pkg("network")` and `r pkg("igraph")` provide basic
  data structures and tools for creating, importing, modifying, and
  exporting their respective representations of relational data.

- `r pkg("intergraph")` is not a network analysis package _per se_. Rather it
allows to easily convert objects produced by Statnet packages into
`r pkg("igraph")` objects (or a data frame) and vice versa. Thus, it helps
leveraging multiple packages' functionalities and ensuring compatibility between
several users' workflows too many additional functionalities.

- `r pkg("BoolNet")` provides tools for assembling, analyzing and visualizing
synchronous and asynchronous (probabilistic) Boolean networks as well as simpler
Boolean networks. All the main functions are described in a handy
[vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BoolNet/vignettes/BoolNet_package_vignette.pdf).

- `r pkg("egor")` provides tools for managing ego-centric networks, including importing from exports
from [_EgoNet_](https://github.cm/egonet/egonet), [_EgoWeb
2.0_](https://www.qualintitative.com/egoweb/) and
[_openeddi_](https://github.cm/jfaganUK/openeddi). It includes a Shiny app and
procedures for creating and visualizing clustered graphs.

- `r pkg("networkDynamic")` from Statnet facilitates representation
  and manipulation of dynamic networks.

- `r pkg("ionet")` creates network starting by turning input-output tables into
weighted adjacency matrices.

- `r pkg("rgraph6")` allows to encode relational data (adjacency matrices, edge
lists, `r pkg("network")` and `r pkg("igraph")` objects) as ASCII strings and
vice versa using `graph6`, `sparse6`, and `digraph6`
[formats](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt).

- `r pkg("tidygraph")` is designed for handling and manipulating graph data
within the [_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework. It does not make
it into "core" packages because it lacks a comprehensive set of tools for
network analysis. Yet, it provides a flexible piped approach to working with
relational data, allowing users to apply familiar data manipulation techniques
from the tidyverse to graphs. Users can easily perform tasks such as filtering,
summarizing, and joining graph data using familiar tidyverse syntax. Given that
both `r pkg ("igraph")` and `r pkg ("sna")` provide piped functions for most
operations, `r pkg ("tidygraph")`'s added value lies mainly in the possibility
of accessing directly either the node data, the edge data or the graph itself
while computing inside verbs.

- `r pkg("backbone")` implements extraction of a sparse and unweighted
subgraph of a network called a *backbone*.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Moving to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), `r pkg ("igraph")`, `r pkg ("sna")`, and `r pkg("manynet")` offer functions for a similar set of network-analytic and visualization operations, whereas `r pkg ("tidygraph")` is more limited. However, some algorithms differ from each other and from those are some specialized packages for their implementation, speed, or defaults.

### General

- `r pkg("tsna")` implements a number of methods for exploratory
  analysis and summaries of temporal networks in the `r pkg("networkDynamic")`
  representation.

- Reletadly to EDA, `r pkg("NetworkDistance")` offers many measures to compute the distance between two networks based on centrality, continuous spectral densities, the Euclidean distance between the adjacency matrices' spectra, the Frobenius norm of edge-to-edge difference, exponential kernel matrices, graphons, the discrepancy between two binary networks for each edge (Hamming), a combines the local Hamming distance and the global Ipsen-Mikhailov distance, and the log of graph moments.

- `r pkg("netseg")` implements a collection of descriptive measures of network segregation and homophily such as Freeman Index, Coleman Index, Spectral Segregation Index and more.


### Visualization

#### Interactive visualization

More details in the CRAN task view `r view("DynamicVisualizations")`.

- `r pkg("visNetwork")` focuses on interactive network visualization using the
_vis.js_ library. The package allows users to create visually appealing and
interactive network visualizations with features such as zooming, panning, and
node highlighting. It offers a user-friendly interface for creating interactive
network visualizations, making it suitable for un-experienced users.

- `r pkg("networkD3")` provides functions that turns edge lists into a _D3_
JavaScript network, tree, dendrogram, or Sankey plots.

- `r pkg("bipartiteD3")` uses the _D3_ and _viz.js_ libraries for plotting
networks produced with the `r pkg("bipartite")` package.

- `r pkg("ndtv")` renders network objects from the package
`r pkg("networkDynamic")` as videos or interactive animations.

#### Static visualization

- `r pkg("diagram")` was born as a companion to the book _A Practical Guide to
Ecological Modelling_ by K. Soetaert and P.M.J. Herman. But it can visualize as
a flow diagram, a web or grid any network given in the form of a transition
matrix. 

- `r pkg("neatmaps")` tries to simplify the exploratory step of data analysis by
providing function to easily produce hierarchical clustering
(`neatmaps::hierarchy`), consensus clustering (`neatmaps::consClustResTable`)
and heatmaps of multiple networks (`neatmaps::neatmap`).

- `r pkg("manynet")` builds on `r pkg("ggraph")` for graphing networks in
`ggplot2`-style but eases the complicated syntax and offers sensible defaults to
make it easy to visualize and explore network data while retaining the
flexibility to theme. 

  - `manynet::graphr` is for quick, easy network visualization.

  - `manynet::graphs` is for comparing ego networks or subgraphs side by side.

  - `manynet::grapht` is for developing dynamic or longitudinal networks into GIFs.

  - `manynet` includes plotting methods for much of its output, including blockmodels and dendrograms for clustering.

- `r pkg("multigraph")` is a powerful tool providing easier visualizations of multigraphs, various types of networks (multilevel/multiples, temporal, spatial, bipartite, valued, signed), and Cayley graphs with various layout options.

#### Extensions for `ggplot2`

- `r pkg("ggnetwork")` offers geometries to plot `r pkg("network")` objects.

- `r pkg("ggraph")` allows to plot `r pkg("igraph")` objects by building up
plots layer by layer.

- `r pkg("ggsom")` offers functions to plot self-organizing maps (SOMs). 

- `r pkg("snahelper")` is an add-on allowing access to a GUI for visualizing and
analyzing networks. Once the visualization is set, the relevant code is
automatically added to the script. 

- `r pkg("roughnet")` leverages the _rough.js_ library to draw sketchy,
hand-drawn-like networks

- `r pkg("gganimate")` allows to produce GIFs and MP4s version of evolving
`ggplots`, including those representing networks. 

- `r pkg("ggdendro")` makes it easy to make ggplots of dendrograms create using
the functions `tree`, `hclust`, `dendrogram`, and `rpart`.

#### Layouts

- `r pkg("ggforce")` offers functions for specialized plots, some of which also
find application in network analysis. Most importantly, alluvial plots can be
used to visualize composition of groups in a dynamic network. 

- `r pkg("graphlayouts")` adds several layout algorithms to `r pkg("igraph")`
and `r pkg("ggraph")` based on the concept of stress majorization (See also
`r pkg("edgebundle")`).

- `r pkg("manynet")` includes a few more layout algorithms for multimodal
networks.

- `r bioc("Rgraphviz")`, available on Bioconductor, creates a direct link
between the `r bioc("graph")` package and the _graphviz_ library. 

- `r pkg("patchwork")` allows for arbitrarily complex composition of plots that
can be used, for example, in visualizing multipartite and other complex
networks.

### Centrality

Both main ecosystems can compute betweenness, eigenvalue, power, and closeness
centrality, but `r pkg ("igraph")` offers more options than `r pkg ("sna")` and
`r pkg ("tidygraph")` overall. In addition:

- `r pkg("centiserve")` adds dozens of centrality measures for `r pkg
("igraph")` objects such as bottleneck, decay, and entropy centrality.

- `r pkg("birankr")` provides optimized functions for estimating various
centrality measures in bipartite/two-mode networks. It can also estimate
efficiently page-rank in one-mode networks, project two-mode networks to
one-mode ones, and convert edge lists and matrices to the `sparseMatrix` format
offered in the package `r pkg("Matrix")`. It supports edge lists (in the
`data.frame`, `data.table::data.table`, or `tidydata::tbl_df` class) and
adjacency matrices (either in the built-in `matrix` class or in `Matrix`'s
`dgCMatrix` class).

- `r pkg("netrankr")` offers index-free centrality rankings via
_neighborhood-inclusion_ or _positional dominance_ and based on probabilistic
methods like computing expected node ranks and relative rank probabilities.

- `r pkg("influential")` provides a collection of tools designed to help users work with networks and understand their structure and properties including analyzing network topology and calculating several centrality measures. In addition, it provides unsupervised centrality ranking based on influence through a Susceptible‚ÄìInfected‚ÄìRecovered model with leave-one-out cross validation (a machine learning technique). Another interesting advanced function is the ability to compute dependence and correlation between pairs of centrality measures.
- `r pkg("CINNA")` is a toolkit designed to help researchers analyze networks and identify the most "central" nodes. Notably, CINNA supports bipartite networks, where nodes are divided into two groups. The package includes some centrality measures not available in other R packages such as Dangalchev centrality (closeness centrality for disconnected networks), group centrality;  local bridging centrality; harmonic centrality; wiener index centrality (i.e., the network's overall efficiency based on distances). It also allows to use t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) or PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to help determine which centrality measure is most informative for a given network. Moreover, CINNA provides various ways to visualize centrality: heatmaps (compare nodes across centrality measures), dendrograms (grouping similarly central units), scatterplots (between pairs of centrality measures).

## Group detection

### Community detection

- `r pkg("igraph")` is the package of choice for the implementation of most
modularity-based community-detection algorithms. Available approaches include
betweenness, greedy algorithm, infomap, label propagation Leiden, Generalized
Louvain, and walktrap amongst others.

- `r pkg("cencrne")` proposes a regularized network-embedding model to
simultaneously estimate the community structure and the number of communities in
an asymptotically consistent way. The method is mainly used in life sciences but
is applicable across the board.

- `r pkg("linkcomm")` provides functions for generating, visualizing, and
analyzing overlapping communities in networks of arbitrary size and type. Unlike
`r pkg("igraph")` and `r pkg ("network")`, it can compute relatedness
`linkcomm::getClusterRelatedness` and `linkcomm::getCommunityConnectedness` as
well as generate a mesoscopic matrix (`linkcomm::getCommunityMatrix`). Moreover,
it can produce membership for hierarchical communities
(`linkcomm::getNestedHierarchies`).

### Blockmodeling

#### Generalized (structural and/or regular equivalence)

- `r pkg("sna")` implements a simple version of structural-equivalence
blockmodel (`sna::blockmodel`). It can also generate networks with a given
blockmodel as well as print and plot the results.

- `r pkg("concorR")` implements the classical CONCOR (Convergence of iterated
Correlation) algorithm for one- and
multi-mode un/directed networks.

- `r pkg("BMconcor")` allows the simultaneous blockmodeling of networks based on
structural and regular equivalence through singular value decomposition (SVD) by
blocks.

- `r pkg("blockmodeling")`: this package offers and implementation of
generalized blockmodeling (`blockmodeling::optRandomParC`) as well as functions
for computation of (dis)similarities in terms of structural or regular
equivalence and plotting. Furthermore, it includes implementations of the REGE
algorithm (`blockmodeling::REGE`).

- `r pkg("BlockmodelingGUI")` is a Shiny app providing a graphical interface for
generalized blockmodeling of single-relation, one-mode networks from the package
`r pkg("blockmodeling")`. It includes several ways to visualize networks and
partitions using `r pkg("igraph")`, `r pkg("network")`, and more.

- `r pkg("kmBlock")` implements a k-means like approach to the blockmodeling of
one-mode and linked networks.

- `r pkg("dBlockmodeling")` contains functions to apply blockmodeling of signed
(positive and negative weights are assigned to the links), one-mode and valued
one-mode and two-mode.

- `r pkg("signnet")` offers to functions implementing the generalized
blockmodeling with structural equivalence (`signnet::signed_blockmodel`) and
generalized equivalence (`signnet::signed_blockmodel_general`) of signed
networks based on objects from `r pkg("igraph")` 

- `r pkg("oaqc")` enables efficient computation of the orbit-aware quad census.

#### Stochastic (SBM)

- `r pkg("igraph")` cannot run SBMs, but it can generate a random graph
according to a specified SBM (`igraph::sample_sbm`) or an arbitrary hierarchical
SBM (`igraph::sample_hierarchical_sbm`)

- `r pkg("blockmodels")` allows to run the SBM or the Latent Block Model (LBM,
an SBM for bipartite networks) of static networks using a Variational
Expectation Maximization algorithm. Various `S4` functions implement three
probability distributions: `blockmodels::BM_bernoulli` for binary data,
`blockmodels::BM_poisson` for discrete/count weights, `blockmodels::BM_gaussian`
for continuous weights. It allows for SBMs and LBM with or without node
covariates and supports multiplex binary networks via
`blockmodels::BM_bernoulli_multiplex`.

- `r pkg("sbm")` is an extension of `blockmodels` for bi- and multi-partite as
well as multiplex networks through dedicated `R6` classes. It includes functions
to plot the resulting partition.

- `r pkg ("greed")` leverages a combination of greedy local search and a genetic
algorithm to execute (degree-corrected) SBM and LBM.

- `r pkg("dynsbm")`, implements the model for temporal networks which combines a static
SBM with independent Markov chains for the dynamic part. It supports binary and
weighted networks with both discrete and continuous edges. Includes also
functions for plotting (`dynsbm::adjacency.plot`, `dynsbm::alluvial.plot`,
`dynsbm::connectivity.plot`) the partition and automatically constructs matrices
as an array of the right format.

- `r pkg("MLVSBM")` Implements the SBM of multilevel networks where the
different matrices each represent an interaction layer either weighter or
binary. It generalizes the original approach to more than two layers.

- `r pkg("StochBlock")` implements the stochastic blockmodeling of one-mode and
linked networks. It includes utilities to plot the results
but cannot choose automatically the 'right' number of clusters and tends to be
very slow according to [subsequent reviews](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.003).

- `r pkg("GREMLINS")` implements the SBM of generalized multipartite networks
where the different matrices each involve nodes that can be partitioned into 
a-priori defined _functional groups_.

### Others

- `r pkg("clustNet")` allows to cluster units in a network using a Bayesian
mixture model that can account for node and edge covariates.

- `r pkg("collpcm")` provides Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference for
collapsed latent space models that allow to search over the model space,
including deciding on the number of clusters.

- `r pkg("graphclust")` implements an agglomerative algorithm to maximize the
integrated classification likelihood criterion and a mixture of stochastic block
models based on `r pkg("igraph")` objects.

- `r pkg("latentnet")` provides functions to fit and simulate latent position
and cluster model using `r pkg("network")` objects and compatibly with
`r pkg("ergm")` approaches.

- relatedly, `r pkg("VBLPCM")` offers an alternative to `r pkg("latentnet")` for larger networks (on which the latter's package algorithm may be computationally prohibitive). It computes the approximation of the posterior of the `latentnet::ergmm()` function using a Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximisation algorithm. Thus, it is faster than the full-fledged MCMC sampler more accurate than `r pkg("latentnet")`'s two-stage maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Indeed, Variational Bayes tends to converge quicker than the two-stage MLE, too.

- `r pkg("latenetwork")` implements a method for causal inference with noncompliance
and network interference of unknown form on average causal using instrumental variables.

- `r pkg("netClust")` provides a function to cluster one-layer
(`netClust::netEM_unilayer`) and multilayer (`netClust::netEM_multilayer`)
networks by means of finite mixtures and expectation-maximization.


## Statistical modeling

Statistical modelling in network analysis enables researchers to uncover
patterns, test hypotheses, and make predictions about network structures and
dynamics. This section introduces R packages that support a range of statistical
approaches, from modelling static (cross-sectional) networks to analyzing
dynamic, multimodal, and multilevel networks. These methods provide tools to
infer underlying processes that generate observed network data, assess the
significance of observed patterns, and simulate network structures under various
conditions.

### Cross-sectional networks

- `r pkg("ergm")` from the `r pkg("statnet")` ecosystem provides functions to fit, simulate and analyze
exponential-family random graph models (ERGM). Depending on specific needs,
several specialized extensions are available.

  | User-contributed network effects (non-CRAN)                 | `r github("statnet/ergm.terms.contrib")` |

- `r pkg("amen")` offers additive and multiplicative effect (AME) models with
regression terms, covariance structure of the social relations model,
and multiplicative factor models.
It supports binary networks as well as valued ones (assuming a Gaussian,
zero-inflated/tobit, ordinal, or fixed-rank nomination model)

- `r pkg("bootnet")` implements bootstrap procedures to assess accuracy and
stability of estimated structures and centrality indices on undirected networks
(For an alternative see `r pkg("localboot")`).

- `r pkg("fastnet")` allows to simulate large-scale social networks and retrieve
their most relevant metrics following a new approach.

- `r pkg("nda")` gathers non-parametric dimensionality-reduction functions 
with/out (automated) feature selection and limited plotting capabilities.

- `r pkg("lolog")` implements Latent Order Logistic (LOLOG) models, a network
formation process in which edges are added one at a time drawn from a
distribution conditional on edges already added, with order unknown.

- `r pkg("MoNAn")` implements the method to analyze the structure of weighted
mobility networks or distribution networks outlined.

- `r pkg("ERPM")` implements an exponential-family model for
cross-sectional or longitudinal partitions, i.e. non-overlapping sets
of groups, such as sports teams, animal herds, or political
